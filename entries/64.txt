Cook Lake, Labor Day. A big fish! (9/3/90). Yesterday, we entertained Elli, Ken, and Joan - and I decided to stay over. I read this morning, "putzed around", worked briefly on a project, and made plans to leave. I felt, however, that the weather - windy and overcast - might be conducive to big fish movement. My new log "shelter" did indeed provide action and I made contact with a large fish casting from the dock. 

The fish seemed well hooked and I couldn't turn as it swam away taking line under the log. During the entire action, I never saw the fish which exhibited considerable strength. Through backreeling and using my rod to wear down the fish, I finally brought the fish back toward me - only to have the line get snagged on some debris (other than the log). I could not work it loose so put down the rod with light drag and left to get my boat.

Unlocking the boat, finding oars, took time - but the fish seemed still to be on, although it apparently retreated under the log and no longer pulled. The wind impeded me as I tried to work the line loose (from the boat).

Finally, after exercising great patience and putting very little pressure on the line, it worked free. Now I could again more directly fight the fish which I still hadn't seen. When I did work it out from under the log, the size didn't surprise me as I scooped the big bass into the net.

My guess had been a 5 pounder (and that was based on the strength of the pull). In the boat, the lip-hooked bass was measured and released in perhaps 20 to 25 seconds in excellent condition. 

Size: 20 plus inches largemouth, estimated 5 pounds. Worth the wait and the work in what turned out to be a complicated landing process; (My second five pounder out of Cook Lake this season).
