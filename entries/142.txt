A return to old haunts had a merry conclusion. Mimi and I went to Pond C, Three Lakes (Redberry Lake) after a hiatus of several years. The spot was as beautiful as ever – tonight calm and serene. I did some casting from shore, taking and releasing two scrappy largemouths on plastic worms.

When it came time to leave, we found the road barricaded by a locked gate. After trying a number of roads in a quest for alternate exits, we realized that we were indeed locked in. A stop at a nearby camp for help turned up a gracious woman with a key. So another silly adventure was added to our repertoire of late night escapades in the woods. For a time, things looked rather grim as we wandered around on old logging roads in 4-wheel drive over rugged terrain – all this in pitch-black woods. The moral of the story is: Don’t ignore signs that say “This gate may be locked without notice.”

I thank God that health, strength, and incentive still permit these youthful escapades – that I’m yet car topping boats and going into remote areas, in short, doing the things that have given so much pleasure over nearly six decades. 

And Mimi – what can one say about a companion who has been through so much with me… ranging from pain to extreme pleasure, and then all those exciting experiences that would have positively paralyzed some of her sophisticated friends who have absolutely no idea of what she has subjected herself to with me over the years. Tonight’s “inconvenience” was mild compared to some past risks and absurdities. After getting out of our predicament, we went to Vangos for a small Greek salad – the “evening” ending around 1:30 AM.
