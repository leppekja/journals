7/24 – Arriving at the cottage Sunday PM, I was confronted with an active lake (jet skies, water skiers, etc.) and sunny weather. Conditions hardly seemed favorable for fishing – and that wasn’t even my purpose for being there. Nevertheless, I had barely begun to unload the truck when a “heavy” roll of a heavy fish echoed from under Bill’s dock next door. I quickly assembled some gear, and my third cast brought a large form out from under the dock to investigate my offering. 
The big largemouth picked up my hot tail blue plastic worm, and I was in business. After approximately eight jumps and some vigorous movement around and under my dock, the fish was beached (at which time the worm simply fell out of its mouth). It was another lesson in the importance of keeping a tight line, because the slightest slack would have lost this fish: 19 ½ inches, estimated 4 ½ pounds – released immediately. Brigitte, Joe, and Alexandra were in Munising and missed the action.
Later several panfish were also taken.
