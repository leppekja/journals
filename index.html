                <p class="text">A return to old haunts had a merry conclusion. Mimi and I went to Pond C, Three Lakes (Redberry Lake) after a hiatus of several years. The spot was as beautiful as ever – tonight calm and serene. I did some casting from shore, taking and releasing two scrappy largemouths on plastic worms.
                </p>
                <p class="text">When it came time to leave, we found the road barricaded by a locked gate. After trying a number of roads in a quest for alternate exits, we realized that we were indeed locked in. A stop at a nearby camp for help turned up a gracious woman with a key. So another silly adventure was added to our repertoire of late night escapades in the woods. For a time, things looked rather grim as we wandered around on old logging roads in 4-wheel drive over rugged terrain – all this in pitch-black woods. The moral of the story is: Don’t ignore signs that say “This gate may be locked without notice.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">I thank God that health, strength, and incentive still permit these youthful escapades – that I’m yet car topping boats and going into remote areas, in short, doing the things that have given so much pleasure over nearly six decades. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">And Mimi – what can one say about a companion who has been through so much with me… ranging from pain to extreme pleasure, and then all those exciting experiences that would have positively paralyzed some of her sophisticated friends who have absolutely no idea of what she has subjected herself to with me over the years. Tonight’s “inconvenience” was mild compared to some past risks and absurdities. After getting out of our predicament, we went to Vangos for a small Greek salad – the “evening” ending around 1:30 AM.

                <p class="text"> I put the new Lowe boat in on Lake Michigamme while visiting with Joe and Brigitte. Not much was accomplished in the way of fishing, as the event was mainly social. Some casual casting was unproductive. I did learn something of the rock hazards of the lake. Much of the water near the landing has rock piles which protrude. Navigation is tricky, all over the lake.</p>

                <p class="text">Cook Lake, Labor Day. A big fish! (9/3/90). Yesterday, we entertained Elli, Ken, and Joan - and I decided to stay over. I read this morning, "putzed around", worked briefly on a project, and made plans to leave. I felt, however, that the weather - windy and overcast - might be conducive to big fish movement. My new log "shelter" did indeed provide action and I made contact with a large fish casting from the dock. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">The fish seemed well hooked and I couldn't turn as it swam away taking line under the log. During the entire action, I never saw the fish which exhibited considerable strength. Through backreeling and using my rod to wear down the fish, I finally brought the fish back toward me - only to have the line get snagged on some debris (other than the log). I could not work it loose so put down the rod with light drag and left to get my boat.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Unlocking the boat, finding oars, took time - but the fish seemed still to be on, although it apparently retreated under the log and no longer pulled. The wind impeded me as I tried to work the line loose (from the boat). Finally, after exercising great patience and putting very little pressure on the line, it worked free. Now I could again more directly fight the fish which I still hadn't seen. When I did work it out from under the log, the size didn't surprise me as I scooped the big bass into the net.
                </p>
                <p class="text">My guess had been a 5 pounder (and that was based on the strength of the pull). In the boat, the lip-hooked bass was measured and released in perhaps 20 to 25 seconds in excellent condition. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">Size: 20 plus inches largemouth, estimated 5 pounds. Worth the wait and the work in what turned out to be a complicated landing process; (My second five pounder out of Cook Lake this season).

                    Keeping a Tight Line

                <p class="text">7/24 – Arriving at the cottage Sunday PM, I was confronted with an active lake (jet skis, water skiers, etc.) and sunny weather. Conditions hardly seemed favorable for fishing – and that wasn’t even my purpose for being there. Nevertheless, I had barely begun to unload the truck when a “heavy” roll of a heavy fish echoed from under Bill’s dock next door. I quickly assembled some gear, and my third cast brought a large form out from under the dock to investigate my offering.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    The big largemouth picked up my hot teal blue plastic worm, and I was in business. After approximately eight jumps and some vigorous movement around and under my dock, the fish was beached (at which time the worm simply fell out of its mouth). It was another lesson in the importance of keeping a tight line, because the slightest slack would have lost this fish: 19 ½ inches, estimated 4 ½ pounds – released immediately.</p> 
                    <p class="text">Brigitte, Joe, and Alexandra were in Munising and missed the action. Later several panfish were also taken. </p>
