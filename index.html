                <p class="text">A return to old haunts had a merry conclusion. Mimi and I went to Pond C, Three Lakes (Redberry Lake) after a hiatus of several years. The spot was as beautiful as ever – tonight calm and serene. I did some casting from shore, taking and releasing two scrappy largemouths on plastic worms.
                </p>
                <p class="text">When it came time to leave, we found the road barricaded by a locked gate. After trying a number of roads in a quest for alternate exits, we realized that we were indeed locked in. A stop at a nearby camp for help turned up a gracious woman with a key. So another silly adventure was added to our repertoire of late night escapades in the woods. For a time, things looked rather grim as we wandered around on old logging roads in 4-wheel drive over rugged terrain – all this in pitch-black woods. The moral of the story is: Don’t ignore signs that say “This gate may be locked without notice.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">I thank God that health, strength, and incentive still permit these youthful escapades – that I’m yet car topping boats and going into remote areas, in short, doing the things that have given so much pleasure over nearly six decades. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">And Mimi – what can one say about a companion who has been through so much with me… ranging from pain to extreme pleasure, and then all those exciting experiences that would have positively paralyzed some of her sophisticated friends who have absolutely no idea of what she has subjected herself to with me over the years. Tonight’s “inconvenience” was mild compared to some past risks and absurdities. After getting out of our predicament, we went to Vangos for a small Greek salad – the “evening” ending around 1:30 AM.

                <p class="text"> I put the new Lowe boat in on Lake Michigamme while visiting with Joe and Brigitte. Not much was accomplished in the way of fishing, as the event was mainly social. Some casual casting was unproductive. I did learn something of the rock hazards of the lake. Much of the water near the landing has rock piles which protrude. Navigation is tricky, all over the lake.</p>

                <p class="text">Cook Lake, Labor Day. A big fish! (9/3/90). Yesterday, we entertained Elli, Ken, and Joan - and I decided to stay over. I read this morning, "putzed around", worked briefly on a project, and made plans to leave. I felt, however, that the weather - windy and overcast - might be conducive to big fish movement. My new log "shelter" did indeed provide action and I made contact with a large fish casting from the dock. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">The fish seemed well hooked and I couldn't turn as it swam away taking line under the log. During the entire action, I never saw the fish which exhibited considerable strength. Through backreeling and using my rod to wear down the fish, I finally brought the fish back toward me - only to have the line get snagged on some debris (other than the log). I could not work it loose so put down the rod with light drag and left to get my boat.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Unlocking the boat, finding oars, took time - but the fish seemed still to be on, although it apparently retreated under the log and no longer pulled. The wind impeded me as I tried to work the line loose (from the boat). Finally, after exercising great patience and putting very little pressure on the line, it worked free. Now I could again more directly fight the fish which I still hadn't seen. When I did work it out from under the log, the size didn't surprise me as I scooped the big bass into the net.
                </p>
                <p class="text">My guess had been a 5 pounder (and that was based on the strength of the pull). In the boat, the lip-hooked bass was measured and released in perhaps 20 to 25 seconds in excellent condition. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">Size: 20 plus inches largemouth, estimated 5 pounds. Worth the wait and the work in what turned out to be a complicated landing process; (My second five pounder out of Cook Lake this season).

                <p class="text">7/24 – Arriving at the cottage Sunday PM, I was confronted with an active lake (jet skis, water skiers, etc.) and sunny weather. Conditions hardly seemed favorable for fishing – and that wasn’t even my purpose for being there. Nevertheless, I had barely begun to unload the truck when a “heavy” roll of a heavy fish echoed from under Bill’s dock next door. I quickly assembled some gear, and my third cast brought a large form out from under the dock to investigate my offering.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    The big largemouth picked up my hot teal blue plastic worm, and I was in business. After approximately eight jumps and some vigorous movement around and under my dock, the fish was beached (at which time the worm simply fell out of its mouth). It was another lesson in the importance of keeping a tight line, because the slightest slack would have lost this fish: 19 ½ inches, estimated 4 ½ pounds – released immediately.</p> 
                    <p class="text">Brigitte, Joe, and Alexandra were in Munising and missed the action. Later several panfish were also taken. </p>

                <p class="text">10/12 - Saturday. Warm (comparatively) after tough start for October. Turned out to be a beautiful day. Ran in woods and cemetary AM. Drove to Bergdales to pick up chain saw under repair. Visited Mimi's storage unit and dropped off bicycle - then lunch at Grove. Cut wood at M's, then prepared for some evening fishing</p>
                <p class="text">By the time my boat and equipment were dragged into Deer Lake via the "back trail," the sun was low. Before going to the spot picked for my limited-time fishing attempt, I succumbed to the temptation to try a couple of old faithful areas in the nearby weedy bay. This proved non-productive - and wasted precious time as it turned out.</p>
                <p class="text">High pressure dominated conditions. The sky was clear and, after night fell, the star-filled sky was lovely. But the night was very dark, the water calm, and the fish seemed dormant once twilight passed.</p>
                <p class="text">The "bite" was short - and it would have paid to arrive much earlier (although I would have been faced with almost dead calm conditions under a "high" sky). The window of opportunity was brief, and the fish were not concentrated along the food shelf as I'd hoped, but scattered in the general area.</p>
                <p class="text">Results: 18" WE; 17" WE; 18" WE; 20+" NP, and several fish lost, including one heavy fish that would probably have "made" the evening.</p>

            <div class="post_text">
                <p class="text">7/17 - At cottage with Sarah. Beautiful weather - but a tough SE wind "blew a gale" that minimized the bugs while maximizing the difficulties of introducing Sarah to successful fishing. Ever when it calmed a bit in late evening, the day was recognizably one of those summer times better spent gardening, in an active supper club, or making love.</p>
                <p class="text">It was anything but a northern lake angler's delight. <u>Even the perch weren't biting!</u> Yet a couple of rock bass, a miniscule sunfish and a tiny largemouth helped provide some interest for Sarah who did exhibit patience. One rock bass was quite large. When it was blowing so hard we fished off the docks - later from the boat.</p>
                <p class="text">7/18 - (At cottage) Awoke to gray skies; then the rain settled in (with Sarah still sleeping). My early attempts to awaken my partner, while fishing was a possibility, went for naught. A couple of chores that had been planned will have to go undone. Will not get back here before vacation begins. A mound of work awaits for August and September - re. grounds, interior carpentry, painting, etc.</p>
                <p class="text">When the rain ended we were successful in catching around fourteen panfish of the dock; Sarah caught six perch and a small bass. She is learning to cast, and brought the fish in by herself. She still has to learn how to bait the hook and handle caught fish. (Sarah - eight years old; going into third grade.)</p>
                <p class="text">During the course of own efforts, two larger fish (both assumedly LM) threw the hook close in - indicating too soft a set perhaps. I have yet this year to get back in the rhythm of largemouth fishing.</p>

                            <li><u>Venison chili</u> (using the somewhat de-fatted meat off the bones cooked at length to produce stock); included chili hot beans, onions, tomato, tomato paste, etc. (<u>fair</u>)</li>
                            <li><u>Venison burgundy</u> - used small chunks (very lean) cut from hind quarter (Mimi). Very good! (A hit with holiday visitors)</li>
                            <li><u>Lentil soup</u> - onions, very generous use of <u>carrots</u>; chicken stock added. Excellent! <u>The carrots really enhance.</u></li>
                            <li><u>Salsa bean soup</u> (utilizes Campbells Salsa Bean as base); one can water; 2 cans chili hot beans; corn; added salsa. Good as always from my standpoint.</li>
                            <li><u>Whitefish - baked</u>; perpared with lemon, wine, stock (chicken) and thousand island. Touch of pepper. "Old" fish but turned out well.</li>
                            <li><u>Stuffed rainbow trout - baked</u>; coated with mustard; lemon; wine; turkey stuffing; venison stock. Good, even though fish was quite old.</li>
                            <li><u>Split pea soup (12/96)</u> (made double portion, and it turned out <u>too light</u> on accompanying vegetables as I ran short), carrot, onion, oregano, etc., but did not have celery available. Used chicken stock and ham from freezer on hand; 32oz of peas. [My next effort will readjust the proportions re. veg.]</li>
                            <li>1/12/97 (occasion of dinner with George and Judy) Cooked <u>turkey</u> in (electric) oven rather than T. roaster due to defective plug); cooked "faster" than expected. <u>Ham</u>: tried a <u>low fat</u>, deboned (processed) ham for first time.</li>

                        <p class="text">David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker (ambassador to Iraq) testified. Somehow I didn't find this much heralded report to be either compelling or satisfying. Moreover, such reliance on information provided by a general at a time when people are grasping at straws is unsettling if not frightening. The waging of war is ultimately political and the overall objectives and visionary planning do not lie with the military. How this reporting will play out will be more clear as the president speaks later this week. Tomorrow Petraeus testifies before both the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee. Is all this about a "buying time" strategy to dump the responsibility on the next administration? To quote Joe Biden: "The president has no plan - how to win and/or how to leave".</p>
                        <p class="text">Petraeus is smart, articulate... I expect sincere... but still beholden to his Commander-in-Chief.</p>

                        <p class="text">9/11 - The quality and perspicuity of the questioning (and discourse) seemed to elevate today as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf">David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker again testified</a> - this time before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=59">Senator Kerry opined</a> that the place of General Petraeus' comments in the national debate is unprecedented since the role played by General Westmoreland forty years ago during the Vietnam War (after which so many more U.S. soldiers lost their lives). <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=59">Barbara Boxer's impassioned summary before her question</a> perfectly mirrored my own conviction about the futility of a military solution in Iraq and the irrelevance of current policies as long as the administration continues its present course after such a colossal blunder in the first place in invading Iraq (and subordinating focus on Al Qaeda).</p>
                        <p class="text">> The events of the day in the testimonies are about as close to a nuanced debate on the war as we've seen and Republican Senators <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=48">Lugar</a> and <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=54">Hegel</a> were tough in their questioning. But the bottom line seems to be that Petraeus is asking for more time, limited troop withdrawal and a force level that will roughly equate with last year's number (before the surge) in 2008. This course will likely continue to promote the perception of occupation which many believe is one of the chief causes of violence in Iraq, though not the only one.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Most of the more nuanced, complex aspects of the discussion will be unavailable to the public and will filter through the media such as Fox News and syndicated radio as right wing spin as usual.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Yesterday's hearing was "softball" compared to what is emerging today. For example, Senator Cardin pointed out that the criteria point by point used to justify the surge and passesd by Congress - the objective of the surge - <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=100&zoom=auto,-16,775">had not really been met</a>.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Petraeus optimism - he was persuasive in describing pockets of success - was questioned both in light of the big picture and reports and statistics that conflicted with data he presented.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Senators for both parties used the occasion to score political points and/or enforce positions held - and Republicans seized on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoveOn.org_ad_controversy">defamatory ad of yesterday sponsored by Moveon.org</a> and apologized to General Petraeus for what they considered a disrespectful personal attack on him. Actually, as a soldier, Petraeus commands great respect on both sides of the aisle.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Senator Webb, formar Marine, was <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=107&zoom=auto,-95,792">very tough in questioning the policies now in effect about deployment of troops</a> citing past practices of 2-1 (British at 4-1) (2yrs to 6mo.) - now with 15 month deployments with only an expectation of a year off (2/3 - 1). This gets at the broader question of the degradation of the armed forces, the stretching of personnel beyond reasonable limits with an all volunteer military.</p>
                        <p class="text">> <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091107_Transcript_Iraq%20The%20Crocker%20Petraeus%20Report.pdf#page=72">Biden</a>: "I don't see anything here [of the testimony] that lends to an early and honorable withdrawal of troops" ["tactical" info - no overall strategy].</p>
                        <p class="text">> At 2:15 PM - the second hearing of the day - convened by Senator Levin, Chair of the Armed Services Committee. Levin began with a summary of the military, political and policy content - followed by John McCain the new ranking member replacing Senator Warner Hard as he is about the lead up to the war and the policy mistakes. McCain is unequivocally opposed to any appearance of "surrender" and clearly is willing to grant Petraeus the "time" he has requested.</p>
                        <p class="centered-line-break-symbol">&ne;</p>
                        <p class="text">"I wrote it myself and did not clear it with anyone in the Pentagon or White House," stated General Petraeus of his report... <a href="https://youtu.be/z6PTWsdY7jg?si=ICmIIpY6ppr5_R4n&t=17">summarized before the Committee.</a></p>
                        <p class="centered-line-break-symbol">&ne;</p>
                        <p class="text">Contrasting the opening statements, it is likely that anything representing the very special bipartisan relationship between Carl Levin and John Warner is in jeopardy in this Committee - especially now with McCain running for president. While Levin and McCain both deplore the policies leading to the present mess, they seem to be moving in different directions in the search for resolution.</p>
                        <p class="centered-line-break-symbol">&ne;</p>
                        <p class="text">Since these past two days could mark a significant turning point in the debate about the war... it seemed important to pay close attention to these hearings. But General Petraeus in his bid for more time talks of another report - an assessment next March.</p>
                        <p class="text">> As usual Ted Kennedy appeared to be very well prepared... pressed the purpose of the surge to enhance conditions for political reconciliation, meeting the benchmarks - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv7LrnGglGE">addressing both Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus.</a></p>
                        <p class="text">> Petraeus' drawdown plan (<a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/images/davidpetraeusiraqslide13.jpg">and chart</a>) included no dates (it is "conceptual", based on unfolding events.) "I am not a pessimist or optimist about Iraq." "It is hard." "I am a realist." (Petraeus). This portends a presidential strategy that once again will avoid "dates" - buttressed by a McCain-like eschewing of "surrender," the term being used by Republicans to define any set date for troop withdrawal.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Byrd: "Why should we continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/rugDo-ksp6k?si=3dxm8eQTZIe41Mnk&t=117">give you more time</a>?" Crocker: "We are seeing encouraging signs." (re. the central gov't) - and gave an illustrative anecdote.</p>
                        <p class="text">> Petraeus continued to emphasize the presence of Al Qaeda, and its instigating role in the insurgency - a rationale for own continued presence in strength.</p>
                        <p class="text">> "I can't tell you when we'll see the meeting of the benchmarks" but there are encouraging clear signs of reconciliation (needed to pave the way) - Crocker</p>
                        <p class="text">Imhoff pressed the power vacuum that occurs if we prematurely left - and the Iranian threat to fill the void. Questioned, Crocker agreed that Iran has already committed itself to fill such a void.</p>
                        <p class="text">Susan Collins: "What if the political progress is not made by a year from now? What of our lives, treasure?" Petraeus acknowledged he would be disconcerted - that our lives and resources are not forever expendable... and that there was so much elsewhere to attend to!</p>

                        <p class="text">In a news interview, Senator Dodd called this all "happy talk" - that he didn't know anyone who really thought the situation is getting better. Nancy Pelosi thought the implication of the talks is a ten year stay in Iraq. "There is no change in mission; this is more of the same." - Harry Reid. "They have no motivation for change if the occupation extends indefinitely." - Pelosi. [Pelosi and Reid today (9/11) visited with the president].</p>

                        <p class="text">A local power outage cut off access to the latter stage of the hearing. Ran late afternoon in brisk, gusty wind - staying away from potentially dangerous trees. A very windy cool day. Light night rain. The burning ban removed today by the governor's decree.</p>
